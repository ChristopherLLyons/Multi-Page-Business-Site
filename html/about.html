        <p>Throughout the years, past tyrannical kings, noble lords, and courageous generals, only few names have stood out from this lot of burdensome history: King Henry VIII, Oliver Cromwell, Napoleon Bonaparte. Of noble births, these men derived, and of pitiful deaths have they endure. Only their names remain, etched in history, yet very little of their person resonates through the course of time. Everyone knows of Bonaparte and his victories, and his defeats, yet little is bespoke of their influence. Any scholarly man will tell you how Bonaparte resonates in French culture, how King Henry VIII impacted the culture of an Isle of man, and how Cromwell set forth, in this world, a new era of liberation and freedom. However, this is lost on the common man. A typical person couldn't recognize influence as it stared at them in their eyes. That is why Larry has set forth a new era of man: the liberation of tastebuds. Only someone of pure genius intellect could connect the realm of the chip, a thin sheet of potato, and think to combine it with Cheese Burger, an amalgamation of various plants all tied together on a slab of meat. Every civilization gives birth to a prodigy. The Greeks gave us Socrates, the Chinese gave us Confucius, and these great United States of America, cloaked in the glorious spotlight in the world stage, approaches the thrust of the stage as the audience gasps for breath, clinging to the very air they know they are miraculous to breathe, tension rises with every step, and out of the US steps forth a man. A man like no other. A man who dares to push society to its very breaking point. A man of such dexterity, versatility, and determination reveals before them Cheese Burger Tater Chips. And the crowd cheers.</p>

        <p class="poetry">"Git R Done." What a phrase. Of yonder tale doth the poets weep. Of crimson beauty widows shriek in the night. He stands tall among the Gods. Above him is the Cosmos, below him is pathetic. He hadn't heard of the people's critique, only of their enjoyment. Down came the titan when he learned the truth. Society had forsworn and forgotten his shadowed glee, but forever he roared. Searing and demanding he cursed the revoking crowd. Not a moment fell before the echo decimated eons and eons decimated families. Imprinted on the strands of time the language of deities, however small they may be in comparison.</p>
